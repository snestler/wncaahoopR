Description: `wncaahoopR` is an R package for working with women's NCAA Basketball play-by-play (and other) data, primarily by scraping from ESPN, but in a different way than the `ncaahoopR` package from Luke Benz (lbenz430). This package has a single function for scraping data and then makes use of the resulting `pbp` object within R to produce charts similar to those in `ncaahoopR`.
